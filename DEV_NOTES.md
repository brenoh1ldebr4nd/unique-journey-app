# Developer Notes

## 1 - About the Adventure
  The user should be encouraged to follow a path. Start with just one node, look for interests and create their next steps. Continue exploring.

  But it should be possible to skip the tutorial and create as many nodes as you want, being them roots or not.

  As the software is based on the idea of answering the question:
  'What are my next steps?', all nodes should be directional. They shoud have this progression things.

  You don't necessarily need some sucessor, but you just can't have a connection without a direction. You need to know who goes to where. It doesn't make sense to use bidirectional paths, you need to progress in your skills. You can go anywhere you want, but you just get better in life if you keep going, isn't it true?

## 2 - Plugins System
  At the end of the day it's an open source project. If one wants to change everything, they can. But we need to create an easy way to implement new features and ideas without having to understand all the code base. That will be the plugins system.
